                        Bacterial diseases in guava plants can be managed by applying copper-based fungicides and ensuring proper field sanitation. Remove and destroy infected leaves or fruits. Avoid overwatering, and ensure proper drainage to prevent bacterial spread. For severe cases, consult a local agricultural expert.
                        1. Remove Infected Leaves:

Remove any leaves that are heavily infected with rust.   
Dispose of the infected leaves properly, either by burning them or bagging them and throwing them away.
2. Fungicide Treatment:

Apply a fungicide that is labeled for use on guava and rust control.
Follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
You may need to repeat the treatment every 7-10 days for several weeks to control the infection.
3. Improve Air Circulation:

Prune your guava plant to improve air circulation around the leaves.   
This will help to reduce the humidity around the plant, making it less favorable for fungal growth.
4. Avoid Overhead Watering:

Water your guava plant at the base, avoiding getting the leaves wet.   
Wet leaves can create a favorable environment for fungal growth.   
5. Plant Health:

Ensure your guava plant is healthy and well-nourished.
A healthy plant is better able to resist diseases.
Preventive Measures:

Plant Resistant Varieties: If available, choose guava varieties that are resistant to rust.
Sanitation: Keep your garden clean and free of debris.
Avoid Overcrowding: Space your plants properly to allow for good air circulation.   
Rotate Crops: Do not plant guava in the same location where infected plants were previously grown.
By following these steps, you should be able to control the rust infection and keep your guava plant healthy.

Additional Tips:

Monitor your guava plant regularly for signs of rust.
If you see any new spots or lesions, take action immediately.
Keep your tools clean and disinfected.
